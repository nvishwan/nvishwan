Hey I'm Nilesh Vishwani!

I have work in the field of Data Science and I'm based in Ontario, Canada.

Since 2019 I've been living and breathing with Data and creating various machine learning models using Python and R.

Maths and Statistics immensely motivate me and I always try to grow and learn something new on Machine learning and AI.

I lose track of time when I watch Sports or if I'm playing outdoor sports. You can say Cricket is my religion.
